# Testcontainers Examples

This repository contains sample projects
that use [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)
with different technologies. 
I hope it will help you use it in your own projects.

All samples are build with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
& [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/).

ðŸ‘‰ If you use JDK 17+ & Spring Boot 3.1+ go straight
to the [simplest project](./spring6-junit5/README.md). 
Other projects use older Spring Boot 2.7 to show
how to use Testcontainers without all great advancements
that since were made. As for now, 2.7 is still commercially supported
until 2025-08-24. I encourage you to update Spring Boot according
to the [official support timeline](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support)
to have the best experience with Testcontainers and what not.

Current tests status is:
[![wpanas](https://github.com/wpanas/testcontainers-examples/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/wpanas/testcontainers-examples/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

# Troubleshooting

## ContainerFetchException
If you got `ContainerFetchException` 
because of failing `Docker environment should have more than 2GB free disk space`,
increase available disc space in Docker for Mac. See [more](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/1726).
