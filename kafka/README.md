# Spring Kafka

This is all you need to set up Kafka container that will start along with your application 
and will be running during integration tests.

You can start application locally with configured `KafkaContainer`, starting `main` 
from [LocalKafkaApplication.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/github/wpanas/spring/kafka/LocalKafkaApplication.kt).
